## Hi ðŸ‘‹



I am a 17-year-old student currently studying Information and Communication Technology at Gradia.
In my free time, I enjoy working on various creative projects, particularly in video game development.
I am also an avid guitar player with a passion for music.
My strengths lie in my calm demeanor, strong work ethic, and dedication to continuously improving my skills.
Whether it's building new projects or creating music, I approach everything I do with focus and enthusiasm.
